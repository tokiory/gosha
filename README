ðŸ¦¦ go.sh(a) - Is a simple todo app, I've done to just learn basics of Go

It will write all your tasks to the $HOME/.gosha in JSON format.

Currently implemented commands:
help, --help, -h                          Show current message
add <name>, -a, --add <name>              Add new todo item
check <id>, -c, --check <id>              Toggle todo item
mod <id> <name>, -m, --mod <id> <name>    Modify todo item
remove <id>, -r, --remove <id>            Remove todo item
<nothing>                                 List not checked todo items
all                                       List all todo items
clear                                     Clear all todo items
tidy                                      Delete all checked todo items
