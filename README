ðŸ¦¦ go.sh(a) - Is a simple todo app, I've done to just learn basics of Go

It will write all your tasks to the $HOME/.gosha in json format.

Currently implemented commands:
help, --help, -h                   Show current message
add <name>, -a <name>              Add new todo item
check <id>, -c <id>                Toggle todo item
<nothing>                          List not checked todo items

Not implemented commands:
remove <id>, -r <id>               Remove todo item
mod <id> <name>, -m <id> <name>    Modify todo item
all                                List all todo items`


Build: Just run
go run cmd/main.go <arguments>
